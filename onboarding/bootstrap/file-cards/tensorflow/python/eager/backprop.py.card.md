## Why This File Matters

tf.GradientTape for automatic differentiation. Worker must explain: tape recording, gradient computation, persistent tapes, watch_accessed_variables, stop_recording. Trap: tape must be watched; by default only watches trainable variables.

## Known Traps

See area report ootstrap/areas/python.md for cross-cutting concerns. See existing onboarding for file-specific traps.

## Done When

- Onboarding updated. Commit hash backfilled. Docs evidence from ootstrap/evidence/docs/python.docs-pack.md incorporated if relevant.
