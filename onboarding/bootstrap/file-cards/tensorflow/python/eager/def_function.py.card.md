## Why This File Matters

Re-export shim for tf.function/Function from polymorphic_function. Worker must explain: imports unify Function and tf.function; real implementation in polymorphic_function.py. Trap: thin file; workers must read polymorphic_function.py for implementation.

## Known Traps

See area report ootstrap/areas/python.md for cross-cutting concerns. See existing onboarding for file-specific traps.

## Done When

- Onboarding updated. Commit hash backfilled. Docs evidence from ootstrap/evidence/docs/python.docs-pack.md incorporated if relevant.
