## Why This File Matters

Package bootstrap with version dunders only. Worker must explain: exports __version__, __git_version__, tf_inspect. Trap: minimal file; actual exports come from api_template.

## Known Traps

See area report ootstrap/areas/python.md for cross-cutting concerns. See existing onboarding for file-specific traps.

## Done When

- Onboarding updated. Commit hash backfilled. Docs evidence from ootstrap/evidence/docs/python.docs-pack.md incorporated if relevant.
