## Why This File Matters

tf.Graph, tf.Operation, gradient registry, default graph stack (~6000 lines). Worker must explain: Graph as container, Operation as node, control dependencies, gradient registry, name scopes, device scopes. Trap: default graph threading; Graph.executing_eagerly() semantics.

## Known Traps

See area report ootstrap/areas/python.md for cross-cutting concerns. See existing onboarding for file-specific traps.

## Done When

- Onboarding updated. Commit hash backfilled. Docs evidence from ootstrap/evidence/docs/python.docs-pack.md incorporated if relevant.
